class TrinityUserProfileView(APIView):
	"""
	**Use Cases**

        Get or update a user's Trinity User Profile information. Updates are supported
        only through merge patch.

    **Example Requests**:

        GET /api/user/v1/trinityprofile/{username}

        PATCH /api/user/v1/trinityprofile/{username}/{"key":"value"} "application/merge-patch+json"

    **Response Values for GET**

        If the user makes the request for her own account, or makes a
        request for another account and has "is_staff" access, the response
        contains:

        * username: The username associated with the account.

        * district: The Texas School District associated with the user


        For all text fields, clients rendering the values should take care
        to HTML escape them to avoid script injections, as the data is
        stored exactly as specified. The intention is that plain text is
        supported, not HTML.

        If no user exists with the specified username, a 404 error is
        returned.

    **Response Values for PATCH**

        Users can only modify their own account information. If the
        requesting user does not have username "username", this method will
        return with a status of 403 for staff access but a 404 for ordinary
        users to avoid leaking the existence of the account.

        If no user exists with the specified username, a 404 error is
        returned.

        If "application/merge-patch+json" is not the specified content type,
        a 415 error is returned.

        If the update could not be completed due to validation errors, this
        method returns a 400 error with all error messages in the
        "field_errors" field of the returned JSON.

        If the update could not be completed due to a failure at the time of
        the update, a 400 error is returned with specific errors in the
        returned JSON collection.

        If the update is successful, a 204 status is returned with no
        additional content.
